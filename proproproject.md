- [x] Develop Streamlit UI with interactive dashboard
- [x] Add sample data files (nutrition, tips, daily meals)
- [x] Implement progress tracking with charts
- [x] Add fitness tips and motivation section
- [x] Create comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
- [x] Set up requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Test the application thoroughly
- [ ] Add more food items to nutrition database
- [ ] Implement user data persistence (optional)
- [ ] Add more advanced ML models for predictions
- [ ] Create unit tests for utility functions
- [ ] Add export functionality for meal plans
- [ ] Implement user authentication (for multi-user support)
- [ ] Add recipe suggestions based on available ingredients
- [ ] Integrate with fitness tracking APIs (optional)
- [ ] Add mobile-responsive design improvements

## Optional Enhancements
